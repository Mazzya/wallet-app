## Cryptographic operations

Open source Dart cryptographic libraries for required algorithms state that are not audited / production ready. For this, we are using an embedded web browser
which features the Web Crypto API and use Javascript libs for the cryptographic operations. This is transparent to the end user. Javascript libs are extracted by qubic.li wallet and added as an asset.

## Backend

Your keys are never shared to any 3rd party. Yet the wallet uses some backend services:

### Access to Qubic Network

Access to the Qubic Network is currently provided by the wonderful work of (https://www.qubic.li). We are working with a new version to iterface directly with the Computor nodes.

### Version checking

The wallet makes some calls to wallet.qubic-hub.com in order to check for updates or critical fixes.

# Compiling - Downloading - Running
